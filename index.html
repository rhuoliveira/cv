            <p>I am 22 years old, a recent economics graduate, ready for new challenges. I consider myself a charismatic person
            who brings a lot of energy and enthusiasm to my work. I have a special interest in the areas of data analyst,
            finance, administration, and sales. I like to be constantly learning, like about the financial market, web3 and
            programming language like Python, but also how to develop myself and bring the best to myself and the company.</p>
