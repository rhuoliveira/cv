<h1>Cover Letter</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am pleased to apply for this position in your company. I am confident that I could contribute to your company in a positive way.
    As a recent graduate in economics from the Faculty of Economics at the University of Porto,
    I am looking for an opportunity that will challenge me professionally, so I think this position is perfect for that.
    When I finished my degree I decided to focus on learning to program,
    I started with Python and fell in love with this area as it has endless possibilities to develop and learn.
    I have developed a particular interest in the areas of data analysis, business analyst and other IT areas.
    I would describe myself as a motivated and goal-oriented person with a great desire to constantly learn.
    Throughout my experience in customer service, I have developed several skills, of which I would highlight teamwork,
    critical thinking and communication, which have proven to be very beneficial in my work.
    I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to the goals of this company.
</p>
<p>I appreciate your time,</p>
<p> Rhuan Oliveira</p>
